Functional Interface & Lambda
An interface which has only one method

You can't create an object of interface

Every class in java extends object class
Thats why if you use any method which is object class then no error

Lambda expression can only be used with functional interface
After Lambda show a bit of functional effects 

public int sum(int a, int b){
  return (a+b);
}

for converting to lambda remove return type name and modifier

(int a,int b)->{
  return (a+b);
}

if body of lambda exp contain only one expression then curly braces are optional
java compiler also infers the type by its own so you can remove data type because it can get the 
type information from the functional interface to whose var the lambda is assigned
we can also remove the return type

(a,b)->return (a+b);

public int getLength(String str){
  return str.length();
}

(str)-> str.length();

We can use @FunctionalInterface

Runnable,Comparable,Callable

Anonymous class= A class ewithout any name
